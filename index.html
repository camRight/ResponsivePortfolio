                        <span class="content tab">First and foremost, I love writing code. Ever since writing my first program in Visual Basic and manipulating it to
                    solve a desired problem, I have cultivated a keen interest in the idea of solving real-world problems with software
                    applications. Today, I employ my knowledge of Javascript to solve the never-ending puzzle of how to create a program
                    that does exactly what I want it to do. I strongly believe in the power of programming to transform and improve the
                    lives of people around the world--particularly when it comes to accessibility. Just as we think of accessibility as
                    benefiting those with disabilities and the subsequent passing of laws affording equal rights to everyone--we must
                    consider those with visual impairments when we design software applications. It is not right to exclude anyone from
                    accessing a website. We are all different, but we are all human, and therefore have the same human rights.

                        <span class="content tab space">For my first professional application, I explored refactoring a website's code into 
                            something more modern, concise, and
                    readable. My second assignment explored responsive, accessible website design using Bootstrap as a tool to increase
                    mobile and tablet navigation and readability. I have developed fun quizzes to test your knowledge on a variety of
                    subjects. For many years I have bug-tested and feature-tested various passion projects and software of multi-billion
                    dollar companies and applications that I used passionately and ardently. Currently--I work in teams to develop various 
                    web apps while navigating version control and sequential processing.
                        </span>
                        <span class="content tab space">Even on my own time, I tend to continue writing code. Most recently I have worked on a website for my pickle-ball
                    group's tournament play. I love staying engaged and competitive in a variety of activities--whether it's Scrabble in
                    local tournaments or competing on the national stage in sailing competitions. I find a beautiful crossover in the
                    pursuits that allow me to utilize my skills in software development while pursuing my interests in the things that I
                    love: creativity, organization, problem solving, competitive-spirit, and an enjoyment for the natural world. This is
                    what drives my passion--a never ending thirst to create beautiful, powerful things and share them with the world.
