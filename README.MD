# Responsive Bootstrap Portfolio

##### This project seeks to explore mobile responsive websites in order to demonstrate proficiency in meeting the user's needs.

**Responsive Portfolio** as a project came from the perspective of accessibility. The majority of global
website traffic is from mobile users. India is a prime example of a mobile-first or mobile-only
online population. Designing a website with mobile-users in mind allows the company or development
team to access a greater userbase and market.




## Media Query

If I had started this project over I would have designed this project from small mobiles 
then used `@media only screen and (min-width: 767px) {}` to design from small to large.

File is a whopping 5.95 MB. Compress/reduce file-size for small screens. Since this is an 
exercise in practice I felt like populating the files with a background image was enough. One can 
manipulate the photo in a digital darkroom (photoshop,gimp, etc) and create another 
asset image for small screens.
