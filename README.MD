# Responsive Bootstrap Portfolio

The idea for this project came from the perspective of accessability. The vast majority
of the world world access webpages from mobiles or tablets. Future projects require
responsiveness--building a responsive portfolio lays that foundation.


## Media Query

If I had started this project over I would have designed this project from small mobiles 
then used `@media only screen and (max-width: 767px) {}` to design from small to large.

File is a whopping 5.95 MB. Compress/reduce file-size for small screens. Since this is an 
exercise in practice I felt like populating the files with a background image was enough. One can 
manipulate the photo in a digital darkroom (photoshop,gimp, etc) and create another 
asset image for small screens.
